Landscape orientation, aspect ratio 16:9,

dense city street with heavy pedestrian traffic,
the subject walking directly toward the camera,
crowd flowing around the subject,
foreground and background figures partially blurred,

the model unaware of being photographed,
neutral face, self-contained presence,
the sunglasses acting as a visual barrier,

street-level camera position,
medium telephoto compression,
background motion blur, subject relatively sharp,

natural city light,
strong contrast, mixed highlights and shadow,

documentary street photography,
decisive moment,
found image, not staged
