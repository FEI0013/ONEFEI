the exact same sunglasses design as the reference,
a single-piece monocoque wraparound sunglasses,
compressed horizontal shield lens,
vertically reduced lens height,
thick structural upper frame with minimal lower edge,
continuous aerodynamic curvature flowing into elongated side arms,
no visible hinge, no screws,
sharp structural break along the side silhouette,
arms taper and slightly rise toward the rear,
matte industrial polymer with micro-grain texture,
dark graphite to deep charcoal tone,
no redesign, no variation, no reinterpretation,

Landscape orientation, aspect ratio 16:9,

dense European city environment,
stone architecture, narrow streets, urban textures,
industrial city realism mixed with high-fashion context,
natural city light filtered through buildings,

a young adult white male model,
lean and sharp facial structure,
long hair tied into a low or mid bun,
high cheekbones, narrow jawline,
calm, distant expression,
strong presence without performance,

fashion-forward but restrained styling,
dark tailored outerwear,
clean silhouettes, minimal color palette,
no visible branding,
the model moves naturally through the city,
unaware of the camera,

the sunglasses integrate as a cold industrial interface,
acting as a visual barrier,
side silhouette occasionally catching light during movement,

street-level fashion photography camera language,
slightly low or oblique angle,
off-center framing,
partial body cropping,
foreground pedestrians or architecture creating visual interference,

natural available light,
strong contrast between highlights and shadow,
no studio lighting,
no beauty retouching,
skin texture preserved,

high-end fashion editorial photography,
modern European fashion sensibility,
cool, detached, confident,
cinematic but restrained,
feels observed, not posed,

not commercial advertising,
not lifestyle imagery,

realistic texture, realistic optics,

no branding,
no logo,
no text,
no typography,
no heroic posing,
no redesign of the eyewear
