urban street after rain,
wet asphalt reflecting buildings and sky,
residual moisture on skin and eyewear,
the subject walking through reflective surfaces,
light bouncing upward from the ground,
subtle reflections visible on the lens,
cool color temperature,
found moment,
no dramatization,
industrial realism
